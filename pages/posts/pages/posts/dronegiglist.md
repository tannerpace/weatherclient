## From AirAutonomo to DroneGigList: Tanner Bleakley's Personal Odyssey

Every innovation has a backstory, a journey of trials, tribulations, and triumphs. As the founder of AirAutonomo and the visionary behind DroneGigList, let me, Tanner Bleakley, walk you through the transformative path that has shaped my aspirations in the world of drone technology.

### The Roots: AirAutonomo

Nestled in Charleston, SC, AirAutonomo wasn't just a startup; it was my heart and soul. My aim was clear â€“ harness the untapped potential of drones and offer unparalleled services to the world. As a drone service provider, we didn't just capture footage; we weaved stories, created memories, and transformed raw data into actionable insights.

Over time, AirAutonomo garnered recognition, becoming synonymous with quality and reliability in the drone services sector. Our services spanned from high-definition mapping to intricate photogrammetry, and every project was a testament to our dedication.

### The Evolution: DroneGigList

As the horizon of possibilities expanded, so did my vision. I recognized a gap in the drone industry - a lack of a holistic platform that seamlessly connected drone pilots with potential clients, making the whole process streamlined and efficient. That's when the blueprint of DroneGigList began to take shape.

DroneGigList isn't just another platform; it's a dream in the making. My ambition for DroneGigList extends beyond just connecting pilots to clients. With the integration of cloud-based data processing, we are paving the way for a comprehensive ecosystem where pilots don't just get jobs but also have the tools to process and manage their data efficiently.

The goal? To simplify, streamline, and revolutionize the drone industry.

### The Vision Ahead

As DroneGigList is still under active development, the future is brimming with potential. This platform is more than just a business venture for me; it's a passion project. I envision a future where drone pilots, irrespective of their scale or expertise, have a platform that aids in both job procurement and data management.

While the journey from being a drone service provider with AirAutonomo to conceptualizing a groundbreaking platform like DroneGigList has been challenging, it's been equally rewarding. Every step, every setback, and every breakthrough has shaped the journey.

I invite you all to be a part of this journey. Together, let's shape the future of the drone industry, making it more connected, more efficient, and more innovative.

Stay with us, as DroneGigList unfolds, with innovative infrastructure, and opensouce software, lets democratize premium drone assets and data processing for all.
