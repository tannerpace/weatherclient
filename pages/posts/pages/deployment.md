Setting Up and Connecting a Backend Server on AWS EC2   with a Custom Subdomain 

### Introduction:
In today's cloud-centric world, deploying and integrating applications has never been easier. This guide focuses on AWS, the leader in cloud services, to set up a backend server for a React app.

### 1. Domain Purchase on Amazon Route 53:
- Sign in to AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to Route 53 and select "Domain Registration."
- Purchase your desired domain.

### 2. Security Groups Configuration:
- Go to EC2 > "Security Groups."
- Create 'open-sg' to allow traffic from the internet.
- Create 'internal-sg' for more restricted access.

### 3. Launching EC2 Instance:
- Choose your desired Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in EC2.
- Assign 'internal-sg' during setup.

### 4. Application Load Balancer (ALB) Configuration:
- Navigate to "Load Balancers" within EC2.
- Set up an "Application Load Balancer."
- Attach 'open-sg' and create a target group 'ec2-tg' for your EC2 instance.

### 5. Subdomain Setup for ALB:
- Head to Route 53.
- Under your domainâ€™s hosted zone, create a Record Set named "api."
- Link the record to your ALB.

### 6. React App Endpoint Configuration:
- Direct API endpoint calls to "https://api.mydomain.com."

### 7. Backend Server CORS Configuration:
- Modify your backend, whether it's Express.js, Flask, or another, to handle CORS from your React domain.

### 8. Secure the Communication:
- Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
- Affix the certificate to your ALB for encrypted traffic.

### 9. Testing:
- Interact with your React app.
- Initiate an API call and verify its success, ensuring no network or CORS issues arise.

### Conclusion:
Deploying a backend for a React application on AWS is a streamlined process. By adhering to this guide, your deployment and integration should proceed without hitches.
