ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm Tanner Bleakley, a full-stack web and mobile developer with an innate passion for creating dynamic, interactive, and transformative digital solutions. My extensive experience spans across various sectors, allowing me to adapt and innovate across a wide range of digital arenas.

Currently, I'm navigating the freelance world, contributing to various intriguing projects like North Star Trucking. This mobile application, dedicated to optimizing operations within the trucking industry, has enabled me to demonstrate and sharpen my problem-solving skills in a real-world context.

Alongside these freelance commitments, I'm also developing Kitesurf.ninja, a platform catered to meet the needs and enhance the experiences of kitesurfing enthusiasts.

One of my entrepreneurial ventures I'm particularly proud of is AirAutonomo, a drone company that I've founded. With AirAutonomo, we are currently developing a sophisticated photogrammetry platform and a scheduling system aimed at supporting drone inspections for realtors, construction project managers, site workers, golf course maintainers, and more. By pioneering drone technology in these domains, we are creating new, efficient ways to perform necessary tasks and inspections.

Before taking up my freelance and entrepreneurial journey, I was a Software Engineer at Code and Trust. My role involved contributing to transformative projects like a digital platform that streamlined public service processes, a wellbeing app that promoted healthier lifestyles, comprehensive management software for production logistics, a support platform for developers, and software that simplified event organization for fundraisers.

From a technical perspective, my proficiency includes but is not limited to Next.js, React-Native, Node.js, MySQL, AWS, and PostgreSQL. This diversified technical knowledge base, combined with my practical experience, enables me to cater to user needs across various domains.

My belief in the power of teamwork and innovation remains the driving force behind my work. I am always excited about the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects that have the potential to shape our digital future and positively impact our communities. Let's connect and explore the possibilities of what we can create together.
